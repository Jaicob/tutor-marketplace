Hi <%= @tutor.first_name %>

You have a new appointment! Here are the details:

Student Name: <%= @student.public_name %>
Student Contact Info: <%= @student.email %>
Course: <%= @appt.course.formatted_name %>
Date: <%= @appt.date %>
Time: <%= @appt.time %>
Student’s Preferred Location: <%= @appt.location %>

Please reach out the student as soon as possible with a final location about where to meet up. Remember, not all students have cars so public, on-campus locations like the library, student center, or coffee shops are best!

You will be paid for the session via direct deposit no more than 48 hours after the session. 

If you need to reschedule or cancel this appointment, you can do that directly from your tutor dashboard on the Axon site.
