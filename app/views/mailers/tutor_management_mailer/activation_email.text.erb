Hi <%= @tutor.first_name %>, 

Congratulations! Your tutor profile has been approved, so you are all ready to get booked for tutoring appointments.  Now there’s just a few simple but important things to keep in mind:

Make sure your schedule is up to date and that you are comfortable with all the courses and prices that you have set. 

When a student books an appointment with you, you will get an email with the student’s name, the course they need help with, their preferred meeting place, and their contact information. 

All Axon appointments happen on or right around campus - this is to make it as easy as possible for you the tutor and the student. Student centers, libraries, and coffee shops on or near campus are the most popular locations. 

And finally, it is the tutor’s responsibility to reach out to students and decide where on the campus to meet as the final decision is yours. 

We really want to make sure we help you grow your tutoring business so if you think that there is something that we could be doing better, please send us an email (info@axontutors.com) or give us a call (762-585-4850). 

Happy Tutoring,

Katie and the Axon Team
