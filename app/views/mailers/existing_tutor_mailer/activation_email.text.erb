Hi <%= @tutor.first_name %>,

You are all set! We made sure that your profile and picture updated well and you are ready to start booking tutoring appointments.

The process has not changed too much--you will still get an email when you are booked and it will be up to you to set a meeting place. All of your appointments will be visible on your personal dashboard, and you will be paid for sessions no later than 48 hours after the session. 

Thanks for continuing to trust us with your tutoring business. We know how important it is for us to provide a quality service to you and your students, so if you have any comments or questions, please let us know. 

All the best, 
Katie
COO, Axon
